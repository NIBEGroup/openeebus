# OpenEEBUS by NIBE

OpenEEBUS by NIBE is an open source implementation of the [EEBUS](https://www.eebus.org/) communication protocol with a clear scope:

- Completely written in C for reusability across platforms and products.
- Full support for **EEBUS SHIP** (Smart Home IP) for secure device communication
- Implementation of **EEBUS SPINE** use cases and scenarios. The first release will be targeting:
  - **LPC (Limitation of Power Consumption)** - Energy Guard and Controllable System
  - **MPC (Monitoring of Power Consumption)** - Monitoring Appliance and Measured Unit

## Project status

OpenEEBUS by NIBE is about to be released as open source. The implementation is mature and already supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Embedded Linux**, and is designed with portability in mind for common RTOS systems.

We are interested in connecting with potential collaborators before the release â€” your input can help shape the first public version.

## Features

- SHIP session handling including discovery, secure connections, and message exchange
- SPINE message handling for supported use cases (LPC and MPC)
- Modular architecture suitable for both embedded and server runtimes
- Clean interfaces for integration with energy systems and devices
